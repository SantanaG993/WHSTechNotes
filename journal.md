sounds,movements,lights
Movement is the main thing we use for the robots. Without movement the robot wouldnt be able to move or head in any direction. Movement controls how the robot goes from place to place and which direction. Movement should also be the first thing you learn when you use a robot. And that is How movement is important when using BOLT.

There is many resasons why following instructions exactly as given when learning code is important.
One of the first reasons is because if you dont type in the word exactly as its supposed to be it can mean something else. Another reason is other people can get confused on what your'e trying to say. And that is why its important to follow instructions exactly as given when learning code.

I use computer science 5 days a week in my first period class. Without technology we would'nt be able to do a lot of things. We all use and need technology daily for work,entertainmnet and more. My daily routine would be really different without technology because I wouldnt be able to learn and i would have no entertainment. And thats is how technology impacts my daily routine.

Some skills important to have is to be good at problem solving and machine lerning. The level of education that is needed for this role is a Bachelors degree in computer science. A opportunitie for growth in this career is technical roles to leadership positions. Lastly this job aligns with my interest of computer science because this seems interesting to me and relates to computer science.

Coding can improve problem solving skills in jobs outside of compuer science in many ways. For example one way coding can help in the outside world is for people that work in the office and use a lot of technology coding can help them with shortcuts in many way. This is very creative and gets people to work and think more. And thats why I think coding can improve problem solving skills in the outside world.

Starting off with benefits of AI it can help make things look better like pictures or advertisments. It can also help people with disabilities to help them on certin things. Another AI benefit is it could help give people ideas to invent new things. Lastly another way AI is a benefit is it can make funny entretaining videos people might enjoy. AI can also have a bad side tho. And one of those things that can make AI harmful is giving people fake information. Another way AI can be harmful is by making fun of people and making them look or do something embarrasing that really never happened. And those are the benefits and harmful sides of AI.

One positive impact about technology being apart of the election,is technology will help make voting easier. Because all you need to do is click on who you're voting for instead of writing a whole thing down. One negative impact about technology being apart of the election is maybe people preffer to not vote by technology. And thats what I believe is a positive and negative imoact of technology being used in the upcoming election.

I believe its important to protect your personal information online for lots of reasons.
One of the main important reasons is because theres lots of creeps that could steal your information and do bad things with it. A way I believe you can keep your personal information safe is by not sharing your password with anyone or posting things that people shouldnt see.
I personally have never posted anything with personal information that I later reggreted but if you have I recoomend immediately deleting it and telling an adult. And that is what I think about personal information online.

A current event that interests me is learning sign language because it seems really interesting. I believe it relates to computer science because learning code for cumputer is like learning sign language. For example they both require exact things to say the right word or phrase and they both take practice and time. And that is how I believe sign language relates to coding.

I went to Google and found a couple interesting things about AI. Althought AI could be fun and used to make funny memes and more it concerns me. It concerns me because everyday I see videos with false information that everyone believed just for it to be AI. It can also ruin peoples life by making them seem like they were doing something bad but it just ends up being AI. I do believe you can use AI in a good way like advertising things and more. But overall I think we are better off with no AI.

To me the word brain rot means like making something dumb or funny. I believe digital media had a positive impact on me because it made me laugh many times and made my friends laugh. And yes I also believe that you can balance technology with educational things and not brain rot. The way you can do that is by searching up what you want. And that is my opinion on this.

Something I really enjoyed most about last semester was the minecraft assignments. I would like to do more of those because they were fun. I also really liked doing journals because theyre easy and fun. Im not really interested in pursing any certificate for this class tho.
