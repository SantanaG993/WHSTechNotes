Movement is the main thing we use for the robots. Without movement the robot wouldnt be able to move or head in any direction. Movement controls how the robot goes from place to place and which direction. Movement should also be the first thing you learn when you use a robot. And that is How movement is important when using BOLT.

I use computer science 5 days a week in my first period class. Without technology we would'nt be able to do a lot of things. We all use and need technology daily for work,entertainmnet and more. My daily routine would be really different without technology because I wouldnt be able to learn and i would have no entertainment. And thats is how technology impacts my daily routine.

Coding can improve problem solving skills in jobs outside of compuer science in many ways. For example one way coding can help in the outside world is for people that work in the office and use a lot of technology coding can help them with shortcuts in many way. This is very creative and gets people to work and think more. And thats why I think coding can improve problem solving skills in the outside world.
