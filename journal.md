sounds,movements,lights
Movement is the main thing we use for the robots. Without movement the robot wouldnt be able to move or head in any direction. Movement controls how the robot goes from place to place and which direction. Movement should also be the first thing you learn when you use a robot. And that is How movement is important when using BOLT.

There is many resasons why following instructions exactly as given when learning code is important.
One of the first reasons is because if you dont type in the word exactly as its supposed to be it can mean something else. Another reason is other people can get confused on what your'e trying to say. And that is why its important to follow instructions exactly as given when learning code.

I use computer science 5 days a week in my first period class. Without technology we would'nt be able to do a lot of things. We all use and need technology daily for work,entertainmnet and more. My daily routine would be really different without technology because I wouldnt be able to learn and i would have no entertainment. And thats is how technology impacts my daily routine.

AI Engineer is what I chose as the job. some of the tasks i have to do is learn models ans select appropiate architectures. Some skills important to have is to be good at problem solving and machine lerning. The level of education that is needed for this role is a Bachelors degree in computer science. A opportunitie for growth in this career is technical roles to leadership positions. Lastly this job aligns with my interest of computer science because this seems interesting to me and relates to computer science.

Coding can improve problem solving skills in jobs outside of compuer science in many ways. For example one way coding can help in the outside world is for people that work in the office and use a lot of technology coding can help them with shortcuts in many way. This is very creative and gets people to work and think more. And thats why I think coding can improve problem solving skills in the outside world.

Starting off with benefits of AI it can help make things look better like pictures or advertisments. It can also help people with disabilities to help them on certin things. Another AI benefit is it could help give people ideas to invent new things. Lastly another way AI is a benefit is it can make funny entretaining videos people might enjoy. AI can also have a bad side tho. And one of those things that can make AI harmful is giving people fake information. Another way AI can be harmful is by making fun of people and making them look or do something embarrasing that really never happened. And those are the benefits and harmful sides of AI.

One positive impact about technology being apart of the election,is technology will help make voting easier. Because all you need to do is click on who you're voting for instead of writing a whole thing down. One negative impact about technology being apart of the election is maybe people preffer to not vote by technology. And thats what I believe is a positive and negative imoact of technology being used in the upcoming election.

I believe its important to protect your personal information online for lots of reasons.
One of the main important reasons is because theres lots of creeps that could steal your information and do bad things with it. A way I believe you can keep your personal information safe is by not sharing your password with anyone or posting things that people shouldnt see.
I personally have never posted anything with personal information that I later reggreted but if you have I recoomend immediately deleting it and telling an adult. And that is what I think about personal information online.

A current event that interests me is learning sign language because it seems really interesting. I believe it relates to computer science because learning code for cumputer is like learning sign language. For example they both require exact things to say the right word or phrase and they both take practice and time. And that is how I believe sign language relates to coding.

Next week we are celebrating Thanksgiving. Its very special because it has a lot of history about the piligrims story. We celebrate by having a giant feast and giving thanks to everyone we're grateful for. Therefore I believe thanksgiving is a very important holiday.

I went to Google and found a couple interesting things about AI. Althought AI could be fun and used to make funny memes and more it concerns me. It concerns me because everyday I see videos with false information that everyone believed just for it to be AI. It can also ruin peoples life by making them seem like they were doing something bad but it just ends up being AI. I do believe you can use AI in a good way like advertising things and more. But overall I think we are better off with no AI.

To me the word brain rot means like making something dumb or funny. I believe digital media had a positive impact on me because it made me laugh many times and made my friends laugh. And yes I also believe that you can balance technology with educational things and not brain rot. The way you can do that is by searching up what you want. And that is my opinion on this.

Yes I am looking foward to winter break. Because it should be so much fun to spend time with my family and friends. Im also exited to stay up late and sleep in. And thats why im exited for winter break.

Something I really enjoyed most about last semester was the minecraft assignments. I would like to do more of those because they were fun. I also really liked doing journals because theyre easy and fun. Im not really interested in pursing any certificate for this class tho.

I believe that AI is slowly takig over a lot of things. I think that in a way AI is really helpful and can help you invent more things. But I also think that it can be very bad because it can spread false information. What I would do to prepare myself for it is I would simply leave AI alone.

I would personally put a type of security to make sure the person is old enough to use tik tok. I think the goverment wanted to ban tik tok because it can be dangerous with certain challenges or trends. But i think tik tok can be a good thing because it teaches us important safety information. I was very upset when it got banned because tik tok is a very intertaining app. A lesson I can take from this is that the goverment can take away things very quickly. Another lesson I can take from this is that the goverment dosent want us to have certain things because they dont like it. Overall I think tik tok ia a fun app and shouldnt be taken away. And that is what I think of tik tok.

I believe that computer science can help in dangerous sitiuations a lot. One way is that we can easily send a emergency text to everyone. We can also figure out how to stop the problem by searching up some solutions using technology. Other people can also connect using technology more quickly. I dont think technology can help with all problems tho. But for the most part its really helpful. And even in movies it has helped a lot in sitiuations. And thats why I believe technology can help.

If I was working for the NFL and had to make a application using AI heres what I would do. I would make the card organized and have very detailed instructions. I would also make everyone have a specific role. But most importantly I would make sure everyone understands what theyre doing. Algorithms could also help the application by looking up any questions they have about the card. I would also use a graph on last years scores and give ideas on how we can improve this game. Lastly it would be required for everyone to read and study the application. And thats what I would do if I had to make a NFl application.

The most interesting thing I learned this week that I wish I hadnt known because i feel bad now. Is that in order for the horses to kick like crazy at the rodeo is because they hit them on their stomach. My brother told me that on sunday when I got home from the rodeo.

Technology can help teens use proper slangs with a lot of things. The first way is you can simply search up how to replace words to more proffesional words. I also believe that adults and teens use different slang words. And I believe that they might not understand each other. I also think its hard to keep up with these new words people are using since theres new ones everyday. And I feel like teens should start speaking more proper when needed to. For example like writing something important or talking to an adult. And thats my opinion on this.

I think we treated the substitute good. Because we were quiet and stayed out of the way. We didnt cause any problems its like we werent even there. She even let us play basketball. I think a way we can make a substitute wanna come back is by listening to them. And also being respectful and doing our work. I think the substitute felt nice and not stressed. Overall I think were pretty good with substitutes.

Over the spring break I used different types of technology. For example I used Tik tok, Instagram, and roblox. It helped me entertain myself. It was very fun playing roblox with my friends. It didnt really relate to anything in the class. But some roblox games can kinda be like coding. Overall technology is very helpful. And I used a lot of technology over the spring break.

I believe that AI predictions of sports kinda ruined the fun of it. Because now you know for the most part whos gonna win so whats the point of watching. And also it dosent allow you to make your own predictions. But it can also be good because people can place bets now and be more sure in their options. And it can also help people with facts of the game. Or can help them understand things more. But overall I think everyone has their own opinions about AI. Therefore AI can be good and bad in sports.

I believe AI can help us with the star tests in many reasons. One we can get the answers quicker. Two we can search on how to solve the problems quicker and better. AI can also help you understand certain things better. I personally wouldnt use it tho. Because I prefer to study my own ways with the ways the teacher taught us. Overall I think it depends on the persons opinion. So that why I think AI could help certain students with the STAAR test.
